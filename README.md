### 1. Importing Libraries
This section imports the necessary libraries for data handling, preprocessing, clustering, and evaluation.

### 2. Loading Data
Here, the customer data is loaded from the grocery firm's database into a manageable format for analysis.

### 3. Data Cleaning
In this step, we clean the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting any inconsistencies as well as create the new features by combing severals features.

### 4. Data Preprocessing
Preprocessing involves scaling features, encoding categorical variables, and transforming data to ensure it is suitable for clustering.

### 5. Dimensionality Reduction
This section applies dimensionality reduction techniques, such as PCA, to reduce feature space, improving clustering efficiency and visualization.

### 6. Clustering
Here, unsupervised clustering algorithms like Agglomerate, Kmeans are applied to group customers based on similarities in their data.

### 7. Evaluating Models
The clustering model is evaluated using metrics like silhouette score and inertia to assess the quality of segmentation.

### 8. Profiling
In the profiling step, we analyze each cluster to understand the unique characteristics of each customer segment, enabling targeted business strategies.
